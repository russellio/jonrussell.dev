Before the dashboard, PMs had to navigate multiple systems such as QuickBase, the intranet, and Pivotal, a cumbersome CRM, to access critical product details, SOPs, and progress tracking. This fragmented workflow made managing installations, tracking tasks, and logging time inefficient and prone to delays.<br><br>The PM Dashboard consolidated all key information into a single, dynamic interface.

I focused on integrating Pivotal data via its database while enabling task-level dependencies, customizable due dates, simplified incident creation, and aggregated resources from QuickBase. Project Managers could now track each project from start to finish, manage tasks, and store project-specific notes—all from one location.<br><br>This solution allowed rapid adaptation to individual project needs, centralized workflow, and simplified access to information that previously required multiple systems. Administrators could configure default task durations and dependencies, while the frontend offered drag-and-drop task management and real-time updates. The architecture supported quick development and deployment of new features, and the platform could be replicated for other teams using Pivotal in different capacities.<br><br>Adoption of the PM Dashboard significantly improved efficiency and project tracking. Surveys showed that 67% of the team used it multiple times per day, while 100% agreed it simplified project management, saved time, and helped deliver better results to clients. Early data indicated a positive trend in customer satisfaction scores after deployment, demonstrating the platform's direct impact on operational effectiveness and client service.<br /><br /> * This project is covered by a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), which prevents me from sharing the app or code publicly.</p>",
