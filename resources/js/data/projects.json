    "description": "<p>As a part of the Digital Flag Board implementation, authentication through LDAP was added so users could utilize their existing Active Directory accounts. Once that was up and running, it became clear a more unified way for additional internal apps to talk to each other was needed.</p><p> That work on authentication kick-started the groundwork for what became the Glen Raven API. I dove into research, even traveling to the \"API World\" conference.  I came up with a proposal for a secure, REST-based API with JWT authentication and Azure pipeline management. That effort set the stage for the Glen Raven API to connect systems, share data, and build future apps on a common foundation. The Glen Raven API allows several different applications to interface with each other (client/vendor orders, distribution, metrics, et al)",
